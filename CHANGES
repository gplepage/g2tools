Version 1.1 ????
====================

- New class fourier_vacpol that creates a subtracted vacuum polarization
  function from the Fourier transform of G(t). This provides an alternative
  to using moments of G(t).

- New argument qmin for a_mu.

- New method vacpol.taylor which returns Taylor coefficients
  (shorthand for vpol.pseries['taylor'].c).

- Small bug in vacpol.vector --- set n=20 no matter what n set to.


Version 1.0.1  13/03/2017
=========================
Tiny change to make g2tools compatible with the latest lsqfit (v9).
